# Final Project
- **Subject:** Programowanie w jÄ™zyku C++
- **Author:** Tomasz Janeczko

### Implementation
- The game was implemented in C++ with SFML (a non-standard library for C++).
- Remember to adjust your `CMakeLists.txt` for your environment (lines 9 and 12).

### Game
The idea of our game is to click the button and get the highest score. At the beginning, you have a 100% chance to succeed (which means the lowest possible score is 1). With every successful click, your chance decreases by 1%. For example, after 10 successful clicks, you have a 90% chance to succeed.

### Fun Fact
- The world record for the most successful clicks in a row is 53!
- Good luck beating that :)
